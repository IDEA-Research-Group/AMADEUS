# AMADEUS: AutoMAteD secUrity teSting

AMADEUS is a framework solution to enable and help the automatic analysis and testing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of configuration systems based on feature models. AMADEUS can automatically analyse the organisation infrastructure determining the vulnerabilities by querying vulnerability repositories.

## Setting up

### Requirements
The minimum software requirements to run AMADEUS are:

* Python  3
* An Internet connection
* A Redis instance with the Redisearch module loaded, running locally

In addition, if you plan to run automatic network-based vulnerability tests, you may need to install [Nmap](https://nmap.org) in your system and configure your path properly.

### Installation

This step involves the process of retrieving and installing required dependencies (modules) that AMADEUS requires. To proceed, open a new shell interpreter and simply run the following commands:

```$ cd /path/to/amadeus```
```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

For Redis, you can download the Redisearch module [here](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-software/download-center/modules/).
Once downloaded, launch a Redis instance with the provided `run-redis.sh` script. You can run this from Windows using WSL.

Lastly, in order to build the Redis vulnerability cache, you must download the NVD offline dataset from [their website](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds),
and store the JSON files inside a folder named `nvd_data_feeds`, and run `nvd_feed_processor.py`.

The folder structure should resemble the following:
```
AMADEUS
|--- ...
|--- nvd_data_feeds
	|--- nvdcpematch-1.0.json
	|--- nvdcve-1.1-2002.json
	|--- ...
	|--- nvdcve-1.1-2020.json
	|--- nvdcve-1.1-recent.json
```

## Usage

AMADEUS supports two types of execution. In either of those, you can type the command ```--help``` to display the following explanatory dialog.

```
$ python main.py -h

usage: main.py [-h] [-k KEYWORD] [-e] [-a] [-t TARGET]


optional arguments:

-h, --help  show this help message and exit

-k KEYWORD, --keyword KEYWORD

	Keyword used to perform a manual CVE search on vulnerability databases

-e  If the results from NVD must be an EXACT match of the

	Whether the results from databases must be an EXACT match of the keywords or just contain them

-a  Launches NMAP to perform an automatic search of

	vulnerabilities

-t TARGET, --target TARGET

	CIDR block or host target of the automatic analysis
```

###  Automatic network analysis

By running the program in this mode, AMADEUS will launch a Nmap analysis to the specified IP (or CIDR block) and identify relevant information of the target system. These details will be used to retrieve potentially related CVE flaws and vector attacks on an online vulnerability database (NVD).

In order to perform an automatic analysis to a specific network, you may run the following command:

```$ python main.py -a -t 192.168.1.1```

Target (```-t/--target```) can also be a CIDR block:

```$ python main.py -a -t 192.168.1.1/24```

### Keyword-based manual analysis

By running the program in this mode, AMADEUS will use provided keywords to retrieve potentially related CVE flaws and vector attacks on the NVD offline vulnerability database.

To provide your own keywords and perform a search based on them:
```$ python main.py -k "YOUR_KEYWORD"```

### Tips
* Optionally, you can set the flag ```-e``` in both approaches to ensure that results obtained from NVD do not only contain the keywords, but they appear in the exact same order.

* Models generated by AMADEUS and their respective constraints (if applicable) may be found under the directory _fm/models_ .

## Output & Examples

  

Feature models inferred by AMADEUS are expressed using the [FaMa](https://github.com/FaMaFW/FaMA) formatting. A tool compatible with this kind of format can be then used to perform a series of operations over these models.

In order to stage a running example, let's suppose we have discover that the Nginx server of our organization is running version 1.7. To obtain related vulnerable configurations (or attack vectors) we may instruct AMADEUS to derive a model from that information:

This operation will effectively create some models with the vulnerabilities detected under the path _fm/models_. Now, lets try to load the model with a FaMa compatible tool (like [FaMaShell-Docker](https://github.com/FaMaFW/FaMaShell-Docker)) and apply some operations over it:
